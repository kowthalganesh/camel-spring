        This example shows how to use Servlet REST to define REST endpoints in Camel routes using the Rest DSL

        <br/>

        For Java DSL the routes are defined in Java code, in the <code>org.apache.camel.example.rest.RestRouteBuilder</code>
        class.
        
        <p/>
        There is a <i>provider</i> REST service that supports the following operations
        <ul>
            <li>GET /rest/provider/{id} - to view a specific user by  with the given user id</li>
            <li>GET /rest/provider/ - to view all users from excel data</li>
            <li>GET /rest/ionservice/ - to view all users from MDR service </li>
        </ul>

        From a web browser you can access the services using the following links

        <ul>
            <li><a href="rest/provider/123">provider/123</a> - to view the users from hardcoded / excel with id 123</li>
            <li><a href="rest/provider/">provider/</a> - to list all users from docs/ hardcoded values</li>
            <li><a href="rest/ionservice/">Users/</a> - to list all MDR users</li>
        </ul>
